## USB-to-RS232 Cable

The [cable I own](https://www.plccable.com/automation-direct-koyo-usb-d2-dscbl-and-click-plcs/)


### Internals

#### [1] CH340G (USB to Serial Converter)

This IC converts USB to RS232. One major difference between the two that needs converting is the voltage
levels used for signaling.

For example, a lot of USB communication is at `5V`, however
RS232 communication is in a range:
- `-15 V` - `-3 V` for 0, also called space
- `+3 V` - `15 V` for 1, also called mark

However, these voltages are not generated by this IC, they are provided by the next chip:

#### [2] SP232EEN (RS232 Voltage Generator)

[Datasheet](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/146/sp202e_sp232e_sp233e-1820334.pdf)

This IC generates the necessary voltages for RS232 communication.

## Upgrades for 5V Power

Certain devices, such as my HMI
